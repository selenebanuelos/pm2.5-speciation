### Description

Project focused on analysis of PM2.5 chemical species and relationship with adverse health outcomes. The data used for this project was created by Washington University in St. Louis's Atmospheric Compostion Analysis Group and can be found here: https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/

These data are mean estimated mass concentrations reported in ug/m^3 at 0.01x0.01 degree resolution for total PM2.5, sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), organic matter (OM), black carbon (BC), mineral dust (DUST), and sea salt (SS).
